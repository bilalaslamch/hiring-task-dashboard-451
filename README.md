## 🎯 Design Decisions & Assumptions

### Technical Decisions

1. **App Router over Pages Router**

1. Leveraged Next.js 14's App Router for better performance and developer experience
1. Server-side rendering for camera headers and metadata
1. Proper loading states and error boundaries

1. **Component Architecture**

1. Modular, reusable components following single responsibility principle
1. Proper separation of concerns between UI and business logic
1. Custom hooks for complex state management

1. **API Integration Strategy**

1. Centralized API client with consistent error handling
1. Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
1. Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

1. **Routing Strategy**

1. RESTful URL structure: `/demographics/[cameraId]`
1. Dynamic routing for better UX and SEO
1. Proper 404 handling for invalid resources

### UX/UI Decisions

1. **Responsive Design**

1. Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
1. Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
1. Touch-friendly interface elements

1. **Loading States**

1. Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
1. Suspense boundaries for progressive loading
1. Meaningful loading indicators

1. **Error Handling**

1. User-friendly error messages
1. Graceful fallbacks for API failures
1. Error boundaries to prevent app crashes

### Assumptions Made

1. **API Behavior**

1. Tags can be either strings or objects with `{id, name, color}` structure
1. Demographics configuration has a one-to-one relationship with cameras
1. API responses follow the documented schema

1. **User Workflow**

1. Users primarily navigate from camera list to specific camera analytics
1. Demographics configuration is managed per camera
1. Real-time data updates are preferred over cached data

1. **Business Logic**

1. Only cameras with demographics configuration can show analytics
1. Pagination defaults to 20 items per page
1. Date filters are optional and use local datetime format
